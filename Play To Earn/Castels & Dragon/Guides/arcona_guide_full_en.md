# Comprehensive Guide: Earning Income and Managing Assets in Arcona Metaverse

## Introduction

Welcome to the guide for the Arcona Metaverse economy, focusing on NFT Castles and other in-game activities. This isn't just another GameFi project in the metaverse; it's a meticulously designed economic system developed by the Arcona team to place the control over asset value, and primarily the ARCONA token's value, directly into the hands of its community.

At the core of this system lies a unique dual-token model utilizing **ARCONA** and the internal stable currency, **Gold** (where 1 Gold = 1 USDT). Gold serves as the **lifeblood of the Arcona metaverse economy**: all transactions, purchases of digital land, resources, NFT assets (including Castles and Dragons), P2P trading, and participation in activities (such as Tournaments) — are conducted exclusively in Gold.

So, what is **ARCONA's** role? It's pivotal: ARCONA is the **only way to acquire the Gold** needed for any economic action within the metaverse. And this reveals the **core mechanism through which the community influences ARCONA's value**:

*   **Each time participants purchase Gold using ARCONA tokens, those ARCONA tokens received by the project's treasury are burned** (until parity of 1 ARCONA = 1 USDT is reached).

Within this powerful economic engine, your primary way to earn is by generating in-game resources through **active participation**, often represented as **Silver**. Therefore, a **key goal** for participants is to understand how to accumulate Silver and then utilize the unified exchange system. This system allows you to convert **any** earned Silver into stable **Gold** (needed for most in-metaverse actions) or directly into the cryptocurrency **ARCONA (BSC)**, provided specific conditions are met and you understand the mechanics.

This guide, based on the official "Terms of Participation" and articles describing the exchange system, is your key to understanding how to effectively participate in "Castles & Dragons", earn, and **leverage the embedded mechanisms to manage the ARCONA token's value together with the community.**

## Quick Start / TL;DR

Arcona offers two main playstyles for earning **Silver**:

1.  **Landlord (Castle Owner): Constant Generation + Defense/Attack**
    *   **What to do:** Collect a full **NFT set** (Castle, Title, Domain, Land) + install **combat units** in the Castle.
    *   **Result:** The Castle **constantly generates Silver**. Units are needed for **defense** against Hunters and for **attacking** other Landlords.
    *   **Specifics:** Requires **staking Gold** after ~6 months to continue generation and withdraw Silver. Income is steady but **needs protection**.

2.  **Hunter (Collector / Raider): Active Acquisition**
    *   **What to do:**
        *   **Simple Path:** Find and open **Silver chests** while exploring the Arcona world.
        *   **Complex Path:** Buy **combat units** (Wyverns, etc.), **attack** other players' Castles (Landlords), and **plunder** their Silver.
    *   **Result:** Silver earnings depend on **your activity** and success in searching or combat.

**Exchanging ANY Silver (Universal System):**

*   **Mechanism:** All Silver-to-Gold or Silver-to-ARCONA exchanges happen via the **Telegram bot Eva**.
*   **COMPLEXITY:** This exchange **ALWAYS requires meeting conditions**:
    *   You need to **hold** ARCONA ETH tokens (for Basic status) or LP tokens (for Premium).
    *   You need to maintain a **Hunter Level** (User Level).
    *   **Karma** (from activity, resets monthly!) affects the **amount of ARCONA received**.
    *   **Exchange Cards** are needed for ARCONA exchange (up to 60M Silver).
*   **Conclusion:** Active management of Level, Holds, and Karma is **necessary for EVERYONE** who wants to effectively exchange **any** earned Silver.

## Section 1: Account and Wallet Setup

Before you start, you need to:

1.  **Register:** Create an account in the Arcona mobile app.
2.  **Link Crypto Wallet:** **Mandatory** - Connect your crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to your account on the Arcona portal using WEB 3.0 registration (Single Sign-On).
3.  **Single Wallet:** Only one wallet can be linked to one game account.
4.  **All Assets in Wallet:** Ensure all necessary NFTs (Castles, Titles, Domains, Lands) and tokens (ARCONA ETH, LP tokens for holds) are in this **linked** wallet.

---

## Section 2: The Landlord Role - Constant Generation and Castle Management

This path is based on owning and managing NFT Castles.

### 2.1. Step 1: Create a Functional and Secured Castle

*   **Generation Basis:** Collect a **full set of NFTs of the same level** (Castle, Title, Domain, Lands) in your wallet.
    *(Levels: 7 levels from Knight to Dragon. Titles: 1 per level, Grandmaster for 1-5. See full Terms of Participation).*
*   **Security Basis:** Install **combat units** (Garrison: Wyverns, Galleons, Cannoneers, etc.) in your Castle. They are necessary for:
    *   **Defending** your treasury from Hunter/Raider attacks.
    *   **Attacking** other Landlords' Castles (if you choose this path).
*   **Important:** Without defense, your "constant income" can be plundered!

### 2.2. Step 2: Silver Generation and Management

*   **Generation:** A functional Castle **automatically generates Silver**. The rate depends on the level and **Boost Staking** (increase up to 100% via Gold staking, available later).
*   **Depreciation and Mandatory Staking:**
    *   After ~6 months of generation (covering the NFT Castle's "value"), the Castle **stops**.
    *   To **resume generation** and **withdraw** accumulated Silver, **Mandatory Staking** is required (staking **Gold** in the Castle's treasury).
    *   The required Gold amount increases cyclically. *(See example table for Knight's Castle in full Terms).*
    *   Staked Gold can be withdrawn, but the Castle stops. Only the Castle depreciates. Level 0 requires no staking.

### 2.3. How to Activate Mandatory Gold Staking (Practice)

1.  **Find Land:** Click on your Digital Land on the World Map.
2.  **Open Info Panel:** The plot's info panel will appear.
3.  **Switch to Castle:** Select the Castle installed on this Domain in the panel.
4.  **Click "Staking":** Find and click the staking button.
5.  **Transfer Gold:** Transfer the required amount of Golden Arcona (Gold) to your Castle's treasury.

### 2.4. Withdrawing Gold from Staking

*   You can **withdraw** staked Gold from the Castle's treasury at **any time**.
*   **Important:** The moment Gold is withdrawn, **all Castle operations stop**.

### 2.5. Landlord Role Summary

*   **Pros:** Constant source of Silver generation.
*   **Cons:** Requires initial investment in NFTs and units; needs Mandatory Staking (Gold) to continue; Castle must be defended from plunder.

---

## Section 3: The Hunter Role - Active Silver Acquisition

This path is based on player actions within the Arcona world.

### 3.1. Methods of Acquiring Silver

1.  **Collecting Chests (Simple Path):**
    *   Explore the Arcona world, find and open **chests** containing Silver.
2.  **Raiding Castles (Complex Path):**
    *   Acquire **combat units**.
    *   **Attack** other players' Castles.
    *   If successful, **plunder Silver** from their treasury.

### 3.2. Hunter Role Summary

*   **Pros:** Doesn't require owning Castles (for chests); potentially high income from successful raids.
*   **Cons:** Income not guaranteed, depends on activity/luck; raids require investment in combat units and carry risks.

## Section 4: Exchanging ANY Silver (Universal System)

**Key Point:** Regardless of how you obtained Silver (from a Landlord's Castle or Hunter activities), the process of exchanging it for Gold or ARCONA is **unified and complex**. Exchange happens via the **Telegram bot Eva**.

### 4.1. Exchange Requirements (Eligibility & Limits)

To be able to exchange Silver, you **must meet** requirements defining your **status (Basic/Premium)** and **Hunter Level (User Level)**:

1.  **Token Holding (Mandatory!):**
    *   **Basic Account:** Must **constantly hold** **ARCONA (ETH)** tokens in the linked wallet.
    *   **Premium Account:** Must **constantly hold** **LP tokens** (Cake-LP / UNI-V2) in the linked wallet.
    *   *The required amount depends on your Hunter Level (see tables below).*
2.  **Hunter Level (User Level):**
    *   Your level affects: the amount of tokens to hold; the **maximum amount of Silver** you can submit for exchange at once (or per period).
    *   The exchange limit starts at 10M Silver at level 1. To exchange again, you need to level up.
    *   **!!! IMPORTANT !!!:** Your Level will **decrease by 1 every 5 days** if you **do not maintain** the required token/LP hold!

### 4.2. Exchange Options and Influencing Factors

When exchanging via Eva bot, you have choices:

1.  **Exchange to Gold (Golden Arcona):**
    *   **Simpler:** Does not require Exchange Cards, the amount of Gold received **does not depend** on Karma.
    *   **Rate (per 10M Silver):** 250 GOLD (Basic) / 2500 GOLD (Premium).
2.  **Exchange to ARCONA (BSC):**
    *   **More Complex:** The amount of ARCONA received **strongly depends on Karma**. Requires **Exchange Cards** (< 60M Silver).
    *   **Amount of ARCONA (per 10M Silver):** 90-360 ARCONA (Basic) / 900-3600 ARCONA (Premium) - depends on Karma multiplier x1-x4.
    *   **Withdrawal Limit:** Max **30,000 ARCONA (BSC)** per month per account.

### 4.3. Requirement (Hold) and Limit (Silver Exchange) Tables

*(These tables show how many tokens to hold and the Silver exchange limit available at each Hunter Level for Basic/Premium statuses. The period for the limit is not explicitly stated, likely monthly - verify with official sources)*

*\* Base amount of Million Silver available for exchange.*
*\*\* Final Silver exchange limit (in Thousands) for the period, at min and max Karma.*

### 4.4. Karma - The Reward Multiplier for ARCONA

*   **Effect:** Multiplies the **amount of ARCONA (BSC) received** during exchange. This is a **reward** for your social activity. It does not affect the Silver exchange limit or the exchange to Gold.
*   **Multipliers:**  
![Multipliers of Karma](https://github.com/ArconaEcosystem/METAREALITY-/blob/main/Play%20To%20Earn/Castels%20%26%20Dragon/Assets/karma.png?raw=true)
*   **Earning:** Community activity, referral program (+500/+500), contests.
*   **!!! RESET !!!:** Karma **resets to zero on the 1st of every month.**

## Section 5: Exchange Process via Eva Bot (Telegram)

1.  **Link Wallet:** `/setwallet`.
2.  **Request:** `/exchange`.
3.  **Choose Currency:** Golden Arcona or ARCONA (BSC).
4.  **Parameter Lock (for ARCONA):** Rate/Karma fixed at request time.
5.  **Send Exchange Card (for ARCONA <= 60M Silver):** Bot gives address -> Send Card -> Send hash to bot.
6.  **Receive Funds:** Gold - immediately; ARCONA (BSC) - after moderation.
7.  **Check Status:** `/hold`.

---

## Section 6: Key Assets and Currencies

*   **Silver:** In-game resource (from Castles or Hunting).
*   **Gold (Golden Arcona):** Stable currency (~1 USDT). Obtained by exchanging Silver. Needed for Castle staking.
*   **ARCONA Token (ETH/BSC):** Volatile cryptocurrency. Obtained by exchanging Silver (complex). Needed for holding (Basic).
*   **LP Tokens (Cake-LP/UNI-V2):** Liquidity tokens. Needed for holding (Premium).
*   **NFTs:** Castles, Titles, Domains, Lands (for Landlord), Combat Units (for Landlord/Hunter), Exchange Cards (for ARCONA exchange).

**Conversion Flows:**
*   **Landlord:** NFT Set + Units → Generate Silver → (Stake Gold) → **Universal Exchange via Eva** → Gold / ARCONA
*   **Hunter:** Chests / Raids (Units) → Acquire Silver → **Universal Exchange via Eva** → Gold / ARCONA

---

## Section 7: Important Notes, Risks, and Warnings

*   **!!! UNIVERSAL EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT !!!:** The system for exchanging **any** Silver via Eva bot requires attention to your account:
    *   **Maintain Token Holds:** Constantly hold ARCONA ETH (Basic) or LP tokens (Premium) to maintain your status and **Hunter Level**. **Failure to hold leads to Level decrease** and lower exchange limits!
    *   **Manage Hunter Level:** Your level determines your Silver exchange limits.
    *   **Exchange to Gold:** Simpler. The amount of Gold is fixed for your status (Basic/Premium) and **independent of Karma**.
    *   **Exchange to ARCONA (BSC):** This is where **Karma** matters. Your Karma, earned through social activity, acts as a **multiplier (reward!), increasing the amount of ARCONA** you receive. It's a **bonus** for your contribution. However, Karma **resets monthly**, requiring planning.
    *   **Conclusion:** Basic requirements (Hold, Level) are needed for **any** exchange via Eva. **Efficient ARCONA exchange requires additional active Karma management** for maximum benefit.

*   **Landlord Income Protection:** Constant Silver generation is not guaranteed without effective defense (combat units).
*   **Staking Costs (Landlord):** Gold is needed.
*   **Raiding Costs (Hunter):** Combat units needed + risk of loss.
*   **Karma Reset:** Plan ARCONA exchanges accordingly.
*   **Limits:** Be aware of Silver exchange limits (Level/Hold) and the monthly ARCONA withdrawal limit (30k).
*   **Volatility:** ARCONA and NFTs are risky assets.
*   **Stay Updated:** Rules can change. Trust official Arcona sources.
*   **Security:** Protect your wallet.

## Section 8: Conclusion

Arcona offers two main playstyles for obtaining Silver: the Landlord's steady generation (requiring defense and staking) and the Hunter's active acquisition (collection or risky raids). However, **realizing the value** of any earned Silver goes through a **single, complex exchange system**, demanding active management of Level, Token Holds, and (for maximizing ARCONA exchange) the monthly-resetting Karma, which serves as a reward for social contribution. Understanding these universal exchange rules is critical for success in the Arcona economy. Choose your playstyle, but be prepared for active management to effectively exchange your earnings!
